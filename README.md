GO-SendMail is a simple command line application for sending email messages. It's written in [Google's](http://google.com) [Go](http://golang.org) language.

GO-SendMail can be built on all operating systems that are supported by Go, althought it was created to provide an easier way to send email messages from Windows machines.

The aim is to create a simple command line application for sending email messages with an interface similar to the Linux mail command.

Email server and sender address may be configured by using the config.json file or using command line options. Server authentication was not required at the time this application was created and is not supported.
